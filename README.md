# Redi Fun with java
in this example you have a square that can move if you press right or down.

Your tasks:
- Clone the project from github
- Build it using Maven
- Make it work so that up and left buttons work as well.
- There is no "square" class on the project, create one, in order to organize the square related information better.
- When the square reaches an edge, don't allow it to move beyond what you can see
- Add some image to the moving square
- Rotate the square
- The background is a bit boring, add something to it.
- Change the square for a triangle
